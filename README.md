The project uses [ngx-codemirror](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ctrl/ngx-codemirror) for code editor, it supports a lot of good features like linting, highlighting etc. To start using the module, you need to:
- Add import in `main.ts`
- Add styles in base `styles.css`. Any additional theme should also be included e.g. `@import '~codemirror/theme/dracula.css';`. See [Full list](https://codemirror.net/demo/theme.html#dracula) of supported themes.
